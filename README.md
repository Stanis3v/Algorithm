# Algorithm
 Algorithm - task for interview

 Task:
 Write a function that receives two sequences: A and B of integers 
 and returns one sequence C. Sequence C should contain all elements 
 from sequence A (maintaining the order) except those, that are present 
 in sequence B p times, where p is a prime number.

 Example:
 A=[2,3,9,2,5,1,3,7,10]
 B=[2,1,3,4,3,10,6,6,1,7,10,10,10]
 C=[2,9,2,5,7,10]
